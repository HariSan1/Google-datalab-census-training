# Google-datalab-census-training 2018
This is to demonstrate and explain Google Cloud Datalab Machine Learning model. 
Google Cloud Platform is an useful tool to run Machine learning code and processes. The model is built using TensorFlow and the Google Cloud Datalab Machine Learning Toolbox, which contains out-of-the-box models.
In this sample, a regression model is used. The specific type of regression model chosen for this sample is implemented as a deep neural network.
The code, and some of the explanation excerpts are from the US census regression model in the Google Cloud Platform Datalab sample docs. Based on several inputs, the model is trained to predict wages. The notebook uses Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine.
BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
ensure that you have Google Cloud Platform activated — the setup is easy and fast — and initially free.
NOTE:  After each session, remember TO STOP THE VM.  OTHERWISE, MONETARY CHARGES WILL BE ADDED EVEN IF THERE IS NO ACTIVITY.
Setup Virtual Machine (VM) and start it
Use Cloud shell or SSH to connect
Enable Cloud Machine Learning Engine API
Open a notebook using SSH or through the Cloud Shell.
